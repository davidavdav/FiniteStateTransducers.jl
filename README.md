# FiniteStateTransducers.jl

Play with Weighted Finite State Transducers (WFSTs) using the Julia language.

WFSTs provide a powerful framework that allows the conversion of a sequence of symbols and associate a weight to this operation, usually a probability. 
WFSTs are used in many applications such as speech recognition, natural language processing and machine learning.

This package takes a lot of inspiration from [OpenFST](http://openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/FST/DeterminizeDoc).

FiniteStateTransducers is still in an early development stage, see the documentation for currently available features and the issues for the missing ones.
