# FiniteStateTransducers.jl

Play with Weighted Finite State Transducers (WFSTs) using the Julia language.

WFSTs provide a powerful framework that assigns a weight (e.g. probability) to conversions of symbol sequences. 
WFSTs are used in many applications such as speech recognition, natural language processing and machine learning.

This package takes a lot of inspiration from [OpenFST](http://openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/FST/DeterminizeDoc).

FiniteStateTransducers is still in an early development stage, see the documentation for currently available features and issues for the missing ones.

## Installation

To install the package, simply issue the following command in the Julia REPL:

```julia
] add FiniteStateTransducers
```
